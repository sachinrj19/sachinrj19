Infrastructure as code commenly known as IAC. Help to define, provision, configure, update and eventually destroy the infrastructure resources.
Tools of IAC Ansible, Terraform, Harshicap Packers, Harshicap Vagrant,SaltStack,Docker.
Configuration Management(Ansible,Puppet,SaltStack), ServerTemplating(Docker,HarshiCorpPacker,HarshiCarpVagrant),Provisioning Tool(Terraform,CloudFormation).
CM use for installed and managed software on existing infrastructure resources(servers,DB,network devices). Design to install and manage software, maintain standard structure,version control.
Ansible use to run scripts on multiple resources at once and can be checked into version control repo. This allow us to reuse and distrubute as needed.
CM are idempotent means you can run code multiple times and every time you run it will make only changes that are necessary to bring env into define state.
ServerTemplating(Docker,HarshiCorpPacker,HarshiCarpVagrant) used to create custom image of a virtual machine or a container.
ST promotes immutable infra means once VM or container is deployed it's remaine to unchanged.In case of update , update the imgage and re-deploy the instance.
Why terrafrom- Scripts are  not easy to maintaine, human readable format.With IAC we can manage infrastructure with simple, human readable, high level language
Terraform is free and open source tool developed by HashiCop. Allowing us too build manage and destroy infrastucture in a matter of minutes. 
a-Major ability to deploy infrastracture across multiple platforms.Terraform supports hundreds of such providers, and can work with every infrastructure platform.
b- Terraform uses HCL(Hashicorp Configuration Language) which is simple declarative language to define the infrasrture resources to be provision as blocks of code.
